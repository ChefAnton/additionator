# System Specification: Additionator

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Author:** @ChefAnton

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the system specifications for the "Additionator" web application. The application will provide a user interface to input two integer values and display their sum on a separate page.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this project is to develop a simple two-page Angular web application with the functionalities described herein. This includes UI design, input validation, data passing between pages, and dynamic text resizing.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
*   **UI:** User Interface
*   **Angular:** A TypeScript-based open-source web application framework.

### 1.4 References
*   None

### 1.5 Overview
This document details the functional and non-functional requirements for the Additionator application. Section 2 provides an overall description of the application. Section 3 outlines the specific requirements for each component and feature.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Additionator is a standalone web application built using the Angular framework. It will be accessed via a web browser.

### 2.2 Product Functions
*   Allow users to input two integer values.
*   Validate that the inputs are integers.
*   Enable submission only when both inputs are valid.
*   Navigate to a second page upon submission.
*   Display the sum of the two input numbers on the second page.
*   Dynamically adjust the font size of the sum to fill the entire second page, responding to window resizing.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
The users are expected to have basic web browsing skills and understand how to input numbers into text fields.

### 2.4 Constraints
*   The application must be developed using the Angular framework.
*   Input fields must accept only integer values.
*   The sum display on the second page must resize dynamically to fill the page.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
*   The user will have a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
*   The Angular framework and its dependencies will be correctly installed and configured in the development environment.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 UI Requirements
*   The application shall be built using the Angular framework.
*   The application shall consist of two distinct pages/views.

### 3.2 Page 1: "Additionator" (Input Page)

#### 3.2.1 Title
*   The page shall have a visible title: "Additionator".

#### 3.2.2 Input Fields
*   There shall be two text input fields.
*   Each text field shall accept only integer values (positive, negative, or zero).
    *   Non-integer input (e.g., letters, special characters, decimals) shall be prevented or flagged as invalid.
*   Appropriate visual feedback or error messages should be considered for invalid input, though not explicitly detailed in the initial requirements.

#### 3.2.3 Submit Button
*   There shall be a submit button.
*   The submit button shall be initially disabled when the page loads.
*   The submit button shall be enabled if and only if both text fields contain valid integer values.
*   If a field that previously contained a valid integer is cleared or changed to an invalid value, the submit button shall become disabled.

#### 3.2.4 Submission Logic
*   Upon clicking the enabled submit button:
    *   The integer values from the two text fields shall be captured.
    *   The application shall navigate to the second page.
    *   The two captured integer values shall be passed to the second page. (e.g., via route parameters, state management, or service).

### 3.3 Page 2: Sum Display Page

#### 3.3.1 Data Reception
*   This page shall receive two integer values passed from the "Additionator" input page.

#### 3.3.2 Calculation
*   The page shall calculate the sum of the two received integer values.

#### 3.3.3 Display
*   The calculated sum shall be displayed prominently on the page.
*   The font size of the displayed sum shall dynamically adjust to fill the entire visible area of the page.
*   If the browser window is resized, the font size of the sum shall automatically resize to continue filling the page.
*   The text should be centered on the page.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Usability
*   The interface shall be simple and intuitive to use.
*   Input validation feedback (if implemented beyond button disabling) should be clear.

### 4.2 Performance
*   The dynamic resizing of the sum text on the second page should be smooth and responsive without noticeable lag.
*   Page navigation should be quick.

### 4.3 Compatibility
*   The application should be compatible with the latest stable versions of major web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 5. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Version 1.0)
*   Advanced error handling and messaging for non-integer inputs.
*   Support for floating-point numbers.
*   Operations beyond addition (e.g., subtraction, multiplication, division).
*   Styling and theming beyond basic functionality.
*   Unit and end-to-end tests.
