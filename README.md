# additionator
An AI built web app, started with a simple prompt:
Create a system specification for the following requirements:
- Angular UI
  - 2 pages
  - initial page has title: Additionator
  - has 2 text fields that accept only integers
  - a submit button that is disabled unless the 2 text fields are populated
  - on submit it passes the 2 field values to the second page
  - The second page will display the sum of the 2 numbers in a font that fills the whole page.  The text will resize to fill the page if the window is re-sized.
